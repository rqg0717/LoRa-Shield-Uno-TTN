# LoRa-Shield-Uno-TTN
Example of using a Lora Shield Uno and DHT11 with a single-channel Dragino LG01-P US915 gateway to upload temperature and humidity to The Things Network.

To use this sketch, first register your application and device with the things network, to generate a DevAddr, NwkSKey and AppSKey.
Each device should have their own unique values for these fields.
